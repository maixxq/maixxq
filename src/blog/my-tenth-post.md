title: Graphing with Chart.js 
date: 2020-05-25 11:11:11
excerpt: After following the tutorial Graphing with Chart.js - Working With Data & APIs in JavaScript by the Coding Train, I have come up with a visualization of the total number of covid-19 cases by country. Daniel is one of the most charismatic lecturer producing wonderful high quality content in his channel Coding Train. This is where I learned about fetch(), async function and javascript library chart.js.

> Data visualization is the graphic representation of data and information.

Visualizing data is a powerful tool, translating data information into meaningful insights. The aim of data visualization is to spot patterns and trends in data sets, allowing us to gain a better understanding of the information. Before turning the data into its graphical representation, data cleaning is an essential stage prior to the actual data processing. In order to ensure working with clean data sets, undesire data inputs such as incomplete, inaccurate and irrelevant records have to be removed or replaced. Once the data is cleaned, it is ready to be translated to visual interpretation. 

In the tutorial, we used an already cleaned data set from NASA. The only 'cleaning' required was to remove the last line of empty input which gives `undefined`. And Voil√†, here is the final result! :tada: [NASA Mean Temperature Data](https://maixxq.github.io/coding_train_data_api/data_api/01_temp_data/index.html)

One thing for sure about creating new things is to master the art of reading documentations and applying them to the development itself. Immense amount of patience is needed but it's worth it.

### Fetch API 
> Fetch API provides a Javascript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as `Requests` and `Responses`.

The `fetch()` method is a simple way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.Fetch() returns a `Promise` which resolves the `Response` to the request. Next, different methods will be applied to the retrieved `Response` to identify the body content and how it should be handled. The body content can be in the format of text, blob (image) or JSON (javascript objects notation).

### Async Function
> Async functions can contain zero or more await expressions. Await expressions suspend progress through an async function, yielding control and subsequently resuming progress only when an awaited promise-based asynchronous operation is either fulfilled or rejected. 

`await` keyword is only valid inside async function. The goal of `async`/`await` is to simplify the combination of generators and promises. Async functions always return a promise, explicitly or implicitly wrapped in a promise.

A basic code demo of fetching in async function: 

```js

async function getURL() {
    const response = await fetch('url');
    const data = await response.text(); // if in text format
                 await response.blob(); // if in image format
                 await response.json(); // if in JSON format
    console.log(data);
}
```
As a follow up exercise, I tried it on Covid-19 Dataset. [Total Covid-19 cases Data](https://maixxq.github.io/coding_train_data_api/data_api/01a_covid19_data/tabular0.html)
