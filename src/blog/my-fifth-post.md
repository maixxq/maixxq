> To have dreams and to pursue those dreams. I believe that every defeat and every setback is a prelude to a greater achievement and victory. It's not important if you have setbacks or feel defeated sometimes.. You have to keep repeating what you were doing without having any fear. And you must keep moving forward. - Nobel prize winner Shirin Ebadi 

There are times when I was afraid to try something. This is a constant struggle especially in university. Say there is a module which will be useful in teaching me about a certain skill I want to learn, but I am scared of the bell curve, scared of failures. Fear and doubts creep up when I know that my learning should not be impeded because of this.

This will be a reminder to self that I should always be driven by hope and embrace the fear it comes. 加油！
