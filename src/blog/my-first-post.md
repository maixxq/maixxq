## The Feynman Technique

Feynman technique is a learning method which is insipired by Richard Feynman, a renowned physicist and also one of the greatest lectuerer at all times. This method is used by Mr Feynman himeself to ensure a thorough understanding of a topic he wishes to study. 

This technique resonates with Albert Einstein's quote - "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." So, let's dive right into the steps of the Feynman Technique and explore how we can learn faster with it.

#### Step One

Select a topic or a concept to study. 

#### Step Two 

Explain the topic chosen as simple as possible. Imagine that you are teaching this topic to someone who has zero knowledge with the topic at their level of understanding using simple language.

#### Step Three

Review the information you conveyed. Identify and fill in the knowledge gaps by referring to study materials to understand better.
