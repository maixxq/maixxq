Death has always felt so distant, until it comes. It's painful because there are goodbyes that are never said and the times we didn't get to spent together.

I can't help but tear when I think about it. Knowing how fast it can happen and how little I can do. The reminders that I told myself, I didn't lose anyone, they have never left. It's just that, they've become a part of me. That I will keep living, with them around.

And I still miss you a lot and I will always, always do.
