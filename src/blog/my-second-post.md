title: What I learn from my part time jobs
date: 2020-01-28 20:47:18
excerpt: Taking my first part time job at the age of fifteen and continuing with the part time hustle from then on have brought me exposure to the workforce. It was a decision I will never regret despite the challenge of juggling with work and studies simultaneously. The skills I have gained from being a floor member in the F&B industry, a retailer in Fred Perry, a barista and a tutor are things hardly taught in school. If you are wondering if you should give a part time job a shot during your next summer vacation, go ahead! You might discover something more rewarding besides having a side income.

What kind of job accepts a teen as young as fifteen year old? As what I would still do now, I turn to Google for an answer. It turns out to be one of the greatest fast food companies originated from America - MacDonald's! And so, that was when my part time hustle began.
 
There are many jobs I have taken up during this journey. Other than the attractive pay slip at the end of the month, I get a taste of how businesses operate and gain insights into the different industries.
 
### Food & Beverage Industry
 
The F&B industry is a good place to start for a part time job. Some of the restaurants or higher-end cafes are likely to have a pay of $8-10 per hour, which is slightly higher than the market rate as compared to working in the retail sector (Usually $8 as for 2020). It might also have a more flexible roster depending on various cafes/restaurants.
 
As a service staff on the floor, I have to face the customers and maintain general cleanliness in the restaurant. While tough situations may arise, driving me out of my comfort zone, I am thankful for those parts as they are lessons I have to learn sooner or later in life.
 
#### The art of cleaning: sweep, mop, wipe
 
First, in case it may not come as intuitively, sweeping comes before mopping. Next, do you know there exists a method for proper mopping? It is called the "figure eight" (8) mopping method. Mopping in this manner ensures the remaining bits that might have missed in the initial sweep. If you like science as I do, you get to play with cleaning chemicals (e.g baking soda - sodium bicarbonate + vinegar) so as to remove stubborn dirt on the floor or in the sink. It could be a workout but the satisfaction derived from a nice shiny floor is absolutely amazing. This would earn you some praise at home too.
 
#### The art of communication
 
Facing the customers is inevitable as a service staff. The interaction with customers could make your day or it could be your worst nightmare. For instance, I have once encountered a couple from Spain. Taking their order was an ultimate challenge due to the presence of language barrier. Yet, we have overcome the challenge by combining the help of Google translate and immense hand gestures, marking one of the most memorable conversations I had which ended with a burst of laughter. Some customers may share about their day or their stories and where they come from. Those little chats from customers of all walks of life are really special which also allow me to discover the joy of talking to people. However, there will be times when we have to deal with tough situations. There may be odd demands coming from customers which violate the standard the workplace follows or having unfriendly customers. Though there is no one right solution to handle such circumstances, one very useful tip is simply to smile. Seeking help from the seniors or managers is another way to ease the situation.
 
Nevertheless, the importance of how to communicate effectively is critical between the interaction with others. Putting some effort in changing our tone, rephrasing our words could significantly increase customer's experience.
 
### Retail Industry
 
Communication in retail differs from that in the F&B industry as it involves more of promoting an ite and identifying what the customers are looking for in the shop. Personally, I find the pace working in retail is slower than that in F&B.
 
#### The art of presentation: folding of clothes, display of the shop
 
Working in retail introduces me to some of the basic rules in the KonMari Method - inspired by the author of the bestselling book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Though it does not necessarily spark joy in following the rules, these are some duties a retailer should exercise in maintaining the shop. First, commit yourself to tidying up. Sounds simple, but you would relate to the immense inertia most of us face when we reach the mop in our house. In this case, there is no option as it is the responsibility to tidy the shop to ensure a pleasant shop experience for the customers. This is followed by categorizing products according to its relevant area and how to display these items in a marketable manner. Learning to fold different types of clothing (e.g. collar shirts, T-shirts) is oddly satisfying. Unfortunately, that joy only lasts during working hours. ( Apologies to the clothes-folder at home!)

Everyone would have their unique unforgettable first job experiences. Regardless of which industry or what kind of job it is, stretching ourselves outside of our comfort zones would not be easy. It takes courage, commitment and discipline. One thing for sure is that there will be something to gain from these experiences.
