# About Me 

An engineering student interested in technology, big data and designs. 

> To do work that matters, and make a difference that I care about.

This I hold dear to my heart. Taking a different path, one where we willingly expose ourselves to apparent uncertainties and risks, could perhaps bring the greatest reward. Somethings I really love about life are to learn from others and to share our stories. I strive to be my true self, to love the work I do and to do the work I love. I am curious to try many things of different fields during my years of studies.
